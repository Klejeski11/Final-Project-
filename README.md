Source Control Technology: GitHub

Deployment Platform: AWS

Meeting Minimum Project Requirements:
1. Front End Framework: The application's front end will be developed using React to create an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring, submitting, and interacting with recipes.
2. Back End Framework: The back end will be built using Node.js and Express to handle API requests related to user authentication, recipe management, and interaction.
3. Database: MongoDB will be used as the NoSQL database to store user profiles, recipe details, comments, likes, and favorites. API endpoints will interact with MongoDB to retrieve and update data.
4. Styling: The application's UI will be styled using CSS to provide an appealing and cohesive design for a pleasant user experience.
5. Responsive: The application's UI will be designed to be responsive, ensuring that users can access and navigate the platform seamlessly across different devices.

Stretch Goals:
1. Cloud Deployment: If time allows, the application will be deployed to an AWS server, making it accessible to users from various locations.
2. External API Integration: As a stretch goal, the app could integrate an external API, such as an image processing API, to enhance the recipe submission process.
3. User Authentication with JWT: Implement user registration, login, and JWT token-based security for a secure user experience.
4. Rating and Reviews: Consider adding a feature where users can rate and write reviews for recipes they've tried.

Six-Week Agile Project Plan:
Week 1: Project Kickoff and Setup
Day 1: Project Kickoff
  - Introduce the project to the team and review requirements.
  - Assign roles and set up communication channels.
-Day 2-3: Environment Setup
  - Configure development environments for front-end and back-end.
  - Set up version control repositories (GitHub) for the app.
Day 4-5: Tutorial Exploration
  - Start the Next.js tutorial to understand the framework's concepts.

Week 2: Front-End Development
  - Design and create the user interface using Next.js and React.
  - Implement responsive design with CSS.

Week 3: Back-End Development and API Integration
  - Set up back-end using Node.js and Express.
